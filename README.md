# Super-Todoilst

This was Kai's final project for CPSC210 at UBC.

How To Use:
  -Check out the repository on IntelliJ.
  -Run src/main/gui/TodoRunner.java
  
  
Description:
  A Todo-list of items with due date and another list with recurring todo items, built with Java swing. 
  Each Todo Items can have a location, name, isDone(status). 
  Items with due date are categorized into Important items and Regular items. Important items are displayed slightly differently.
  For recurring items, you can choose interval from daily; weekly; monthly; and yearly. After you cross off recurring items, their status will be automatically updated to be "undone" when the interval has elapsed.
